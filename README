This repo has some of the helper scripts that were written by Jasper Waldman to complete his MAE thesis. 

All scripts are written in Python. Foil generation requires the OpenVSP python API to be installed. https://openvsp.org/api_docs/latest/

The PuffinParallel.py script is written for use on Windows, but can easily be modified for Linux, by altering the lines of code that run PUFFIn through the command line.
